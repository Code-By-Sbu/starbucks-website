Business Marketing Website

This project is a responsive marketing website designed to showcase a business offering both services and products. The aim was to create a visually appealing, user-friendly platform that effectively promotes the business and engages visitors.

The website features a structured layout with a header, banner, navigation bar, multiple sections, articles, and a footer. It includes a landing page and three additional pages, each providing detailed information about the business, its products, and services. The navigation bar contains four links for smooth navigation across pages, ensuring users can easily access all content.

The website is built using HTML and CSS, emphasizing clean design, responsive layouts, and aesthetic appeal. Multimedia elements, such as images and banners, were carefully selected to match the business theme and create a professional look.

This project demonstrates skills in front-end web development, web design, and digital marketing presentation. It highlights the ability to structure content effectively, integrate interactive elements, and create a polished, functional website suitable for showcasing a business online.
